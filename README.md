***Abstract.*** Margin-based deep face recognition methods (e.g. SphereFace,
CosFace, and ArcFace) have achieved remarkable success in unconstrained
face recognition. However, these methods are susceptible to the ***massive label noise*** in the training data and thus require laborious human effort
to clean the datasets. In this paper, we relax the ***intra-class constraint
of ArcFace*** to ***improve the robustness to label noise.*** More specifically,
we design K sub-centers for each class and the training sample only
needs to be close to any of the K positive sub-centers instead of the
only one positive center. The proposed sub-center ArcFace encourages
one dominant sub-class that contains the majority of clean faces and
non-dominant sub-classes that include hard or noisy faces. Extensive
experiments confirm ***the robustness of sub-center ArcFace*** under massive real-world noise. After the model achieves enough discriminative
power, we directly drop non-dominant sub-centers and high-confident
noisy samples, which helps recapture intra-compactness, decrease the influence from noise, and achieve comparable performance compared to
ArcFace trained on the manually cleaned dataset. By taking advantage
of the large-scale raw web faces (Celeb500K), sub-center Arcface achieves
state-of-the-art performance on IJB-B, IJB-C, MegaFace, and FRVT.
